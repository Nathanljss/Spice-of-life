This is my submission for week 7
The entire app is a single page app
I struggled a bit with Routing the pages together but I eventually figured out that I was trying to use both routes and links on the pages which was causing a conflict. I solved this by only using Link on my component pages and Route on my App
There are multiple page components which all work seamlessly on a single page
The main page allows the user to type in the name of their favourite musical artist, an album and a song from that album. Each entry is required.
The submit button will then add their entries into a supabase database and will then update and show the entries on the page.
I have completed all of the required goals an I am extremely happy with how it turned out
This is my favourite project so far because I love music and it has proven to me how much my skills have improved
